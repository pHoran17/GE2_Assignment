## Space Battles:

The inspiration for this assignment comes from the Metroid series of video games. One battle that will occur will be between the heroine Samus Aran who will encounter the G.F.S Tyr, a Galactic Federation command ship that has been overrun by the possessed members of its former crew.
The second battle will be between Samus and Space Pirates while she is in pursuit of their leader Ridley.
